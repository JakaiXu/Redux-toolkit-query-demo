"This is a demo photo management application designed exclusively for studying Redux Toolkit (RTK) and Redux Toolkit Query (RTKQ).

The application features a three-level nested CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, primarily for the client-side. For managing client-side operations, the application utilizes Async Thunks to seamlessly handle tasks such as adding, fetching, and removing data.

On the album and photo management side, Redux Toolkit Query (RTKQ) is employed to efficiently manage these operations, providing a seamless and efficient experience.

It's important to note that this application is primarily intended for testing CRUD operations and currently focuses on these functionalities. Additional, more generic features and details are planned but have not yet been implemented."
